### Library Installation
Use the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\PythonProjects\MyProject
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- `requirements.txt`  
After downloading this file, open the Anaconda Prompt and navigate to the directory where the `requirements.txt` file is located.  
For example, suppose the file is located in `C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\PythonProjects\MyProject`.  
You can install the listed libraries by following these steps:

1. Open the Anaconda Prompt and use the `cd` command to move to the directory containing `requirements.txt`:  
`cd C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\PythonProjects\MyProject`

2. Run the following command to install all libraries listed in the file:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Downloading the Data
Click the green `< > Code` button on the top right of this page and select **Download ZIP**.

### How to Use
Ensure Python 3.x and all required libraries are installed.  
Open files starting with `SpeAna` in Jupyter Notebook to run the code.
